SUGOS is a high-level RPC framework to make remote controlling super easy.

What you can do with sugos is:

1. Declare a function on a client.
2. Then, call the function from another client.

    alt="Over view"
    height="148"
    style="height:148px"
/>

SUGOS magically connect two clients on remote networks and provides pseudo function interface as they are on the same environment.
