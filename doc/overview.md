What you can do with SUGOS is:

1. Declare a function on a client.
2. Then, call the function from another client.

<img src="assets/images/sugos-overview.jpeg" 
    alt="Over view"
    height="256"
    style="height:256px"
/>

SUGOS magically connect two clients on remote networks, and provides pseudo function interface as if they are on the same environment.

It also supports event driven architecture and you can emit or listen remote events in [Node.js events](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events) style.
 This feature greatly helps you to build an application for IoT or Cloud Robotics.
